# Successware21

A Ruby wrapper for the Successware21 REST API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'successware21'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install successware21

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can make calls to Successware21 you must configure the library with a valid API Token. You can request
a token be generated by Successware21. The API Token ties the API request to a particular Successware21 company id.

There are two ways to configure the  gem. You can pass a hash of configuration options when you create
a client, or you can use a configure block.

```ruby
client = Successware21.client({ agent_name: 'name', agent_password: 'password', master_id: 123_ })
```

```ruby
Successware21.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
end

client = Successware21.client
```
